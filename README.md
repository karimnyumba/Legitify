## Introduction 
Legitify is the solution that directly addresses the challenges of document fraud and certificate forgery by leveraging the Base blockchain to create tamper-proof and verifiable certificates. With Legitify, every uploaded document is cryptographically secured and stored on IPFS, ensuring that it remains immutable and accessible across decentralized nodes. This eliminates the risks associated with centralized storage, such as manipulation, data loss, or corruption.
